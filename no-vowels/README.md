# No Vowels Challenge

## Background

If you’ve been on the internet, you might have seen “leetspeak” (or “l33tsp36k” for our purposes!), which involves the substitution of symbols for alphabetical characters, where those symbols somewhat resemble their alphabetical counterparts. In this lab, you’ll write a program to replace certain vowels with digits!

In this problem, you will convert a word to a corresponding word with numbers replacing vowels.

## Implementation Details

- Prompt the user to type only one word (if 0 or more than 1, prompt the user again, with error message of your choice).
- Your program must contain a function called replace() which takes a string input and returns a string output.
- This function will change the following vowels to numbers: a becomes 6, e becomes 3, i becomes 1, o becomes 0 and u does not change. For example if user type "hello" it will returns "h3ll0".
