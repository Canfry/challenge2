# Hours Challenge

## Background

Suppose you’re taking CS50 and spending time every week on each problem set. You may be wondering how many hours you’ve spent learning computer science, on average or in total! In this program, you’ll complete a function that calculates, based on a user’s input, a total number of hours or an average number of hours across a given number of days.

## Implementation Details

You should prompt the user for the number of weeks he has been taking CS50, then creates an array with as many elements. Notice that, after retrieving some data, the program prompts the user to type in either “T” or “A”(must be capital letters). ”T” should give the total number of hours the user entered, while “A” should give the average hours the user entered.

To complete calc_hours function, first total up the hours saved in the array into a new variable. Then, depending on the value of the output, return either this sum, or the average number of hours.
